            <span >Primary Purpose of Mailtrap Use</span>
            <p>You are allowed to use Mailtrap for either of the following purposes:</p>
            <ul><li><strong>Email testing</strong> – using Mailtrap as a fake SMTP server for testing emails sent from the development and staging environments without spamming real customers or flooding your own and team members’ inboxes;</li><li><strong>Sending real transactional or relationship Content </strong>– which facilitates an already agreed-upon transaction or updates Your customer about an ongoing transaction. &nbsp;If it contains only transactional or relationship Content, its primary purpose is transactional or relationship. In that case, it may not contain false or misleading routing information, but is otherwise exempt from most provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act.</li></ul>
            <p>It is Your responsibility to determine the purpose of Your emails and to follow the respective requirements provided by this Agreement and applicable laws. You may not falsify Your purpose of using Mailtrap in order to avoid the applicability of specific terms and legal requirements. Should Mailtrap notice that the purpose of using Mailtrap is falsified by You, Mailtrap shall have the right to terminate the Services for You with immediate effect without obligation to refund any Subscription Fees (as defined below) that have been paid by You but not utilized by Mailtrap yet.</p>
